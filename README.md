# Hey there! I'm Kacie. 

## üëã About Me
I'm currently a junior at UC Santa Barbara, pursuing a B.S. degree in Statistics and Data Science. I have a strong passion for data visualization and enjoy approaching problems with a creative mindset to bring data to life.

## üìç Where I'm At Right Now
I am currently thriving in Scotland, studying abroad at the University of Edinburgh for the semester. Alongside my studies, I am gaining practical experience as a Data Science Intern at The Turing Trust. This organization, established in honor of Alan Turing, is dedicated to refurbishing donated IT equipment and equipping schools, particularly in Malawi, with educational software. I love the opportunity to leverage data analysis techniques to enhance educational access and empower disadvantaged communities through technology. I'm excited to share what I learn when I get back to California next semester!
