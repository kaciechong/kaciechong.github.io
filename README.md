# Hey there! I'm Kacie.

## 👋 A Little About Me 
I’m currently wrapping up my B.S. in Statistics & Data Science at UCSB – Go Gauchos! I’m also part of the top 7% of students selected for the Honors Program, where I’ve built a solid toolkit in computational modeling, programming, and statistical reasoning. From the entertainment industry to international charity work, and from the U.S. to the U.K., I witnessed statistics drive observable improvements, cementing my love for blending statistical theory with practical application.
