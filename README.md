# Hey there! I'm Kacie. 

## A Little About Me
I’m currently wrapping up my B.S. in Statistics & Data Science at UCSB – Go Gauchos! I’m also part of the top 7% of students selected for the Honors Program, where I’ve built a solid toolkit in computational modeling, programming, and statistical reasoning. 

My academic fascinations? Hands-on data experimentation, Bayesian modeling, and uncertainty quantification

I’ve hopped between sunny Los Angeles and rainy Scotland for internships: first as a Data Science Intern at The Turing Trust, then as a Data Analytics Experimentation Intern at The Walt Disney Company. From the entertainment industry to international charity work, and from the U.S. to the U.K., I witnessed statistics drive observable improvements, cementing my love for blending statistical theory with practical application.

Back on campus, I’ve been a project member of the Gaucho Sports Analytics Club, where I built a Stuff+ metric to evaluate pitch quality for the UCSB baseball team. I also currently serve as a Data Analyst News Editor for our award-winning student newspaper, using data to make sense of what’s happening around UCSB.

Long story short: I love data, I love making it useful, and I love finding fun ways to communicate it.
